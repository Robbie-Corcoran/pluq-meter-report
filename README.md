# Pluq Technical Exercise

This project aims to develop a web API in Java using Spring Boot to handle JSON data output from a third-party API that provides meter values from electric vehicle charge poles. The application will manage locations, each of which can have one or more charge poles. The focus is on the project's setup and structure, adhering to SOLID principles, and demonstrating a simple yet effective approach to NoSQL data persistence and RESTful API operations.
